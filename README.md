## What is ansible-nginx? [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nickjj/ansible-nginx.png)](http://travis-ci.org/nickjj/ansible-nginx)

It is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) role to install and configure
nginx. It has first class support for Let's Encrypt but works out of the box
with self signed SSL certificates for non-production environments.

##### Supported platforms:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial)
- Debian 8 (Jessie)

### What problem does it solve and why is it useful?

I wasn't happy with any of the nginx roles that I came across. They were either
overly complex or were missing features that I really wanted.

Here's what you get with this role:

- Configure 1 or more sites-enabled (virtual hosts)
- Configure 0 or more upstreams per virtual host
- Configure a working site in as little as 3 lines of YAML
- Forced HTTPS with A+ certificate ratings (bearing your certificate authority)
- Self signed certs are generated to work out of the box for non-production environments
- First class support for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for production environments
- Tune a bunch of `nginx.conf` settings for performance
- Allow you to optionally declare custom nginx and vhost directives easily
- Allow you to easily customize your upstream's proxy settings

## Role variables

Below is a list of default values along with a description of what they do.

```yaml
---

# Should nginx itself be installed? You may want to set this to False in
# situations where you use Ansible to provision a server but run everything
# inside of Docker containers. You could use this role to manage your configs
# but not run nginx by setting this to False.
nginx_install_service: True

# Which user/group should nginx belong to?
nginx_user: 'www-data'

# Various nginx config values set up to be efficient and secure, feel free to
# Google each one as needed for details.

# Example:
#   nginx_http_directives:

nginx_basic_auth: []

# How many bits should we use to generate a dhparam?
# Technically 2048 is 'good enough' but 4096 combined with a few other
# things will get you to a perfect 100 A+ SSL rating, do not go below 2048.
#
# Time to generate on a 512MB DO droplet: 2048 = 40 seconds, 4096 = 40 minutes.
nginx_ssl_dhparam_bits: 2048

# If defined, overrides the default value for SSL certificate names. If you
# leave this undefined, then it will become the file name of the first domain listed
# in the domains list when defining a virtual host (look in the next section).
#
# Setting this comes in handy if you use Let's Encrypt and want to register a
# single certificate that has multiple domains attached to it.
# This variable should not be left blank as it may cause undesired results
# nginx_ssl_override_filename: 'customname'

# Should self signed certificates get generated? Some form of certificate needs
# to be available for this role to work, so it's enabled by default. You would
# set it to false once you have your real certificates in place.

    # www and no www then supply them like so: domains: ['foo.com', 'www.foo.com'].

    # If you want www in your URL then swap the order in the domains list.

# If you're using Let's Encrypt, you can configure nginx to accept challenges to
# validate your domain(s). An HTTP based challenge is already set up for you.
#
# If you're using this role along with my LE role you don't need to touch this.
#
# That role can be found here: https://github.com/nickjj/ansible-letsencrypt
nginx_letsencrypt_root: '/usr/share/nginx/challenges'

# This is the value you'll set in your inventory to override any of the defaults
# from nginx_default_sites. A complete example is shown later on in this README.
nginx_sites: {}
```

## Example playbook

For the sake of this example let's assume you have a group called **app** and
you have a typical `site.yml` file.

To use this role edit your `site.yml` file to look something like this:

```yaml
---

- name: Configure app server(s)
  hosts: app
  become: True

  roles:
    - { role: nickjj.nginx, tags: nginx }
```

Let's say you want to accomplish the following goals:

- Set up your main site to work on non-www and www
- Have all www requests get redirected to non-www
- Set up the main host as the default server
- Set up an upstream to serve a back-end using your web framework of choice
- Load balance between 2 upstream servers
- Configure a blog sub-domain with assets being served by a CDN
- Password protect the blog because who needs visitors!

Start by opening or creating `group_vars/app.yml` which is located relative
to your `inventory` directory and then making it look like this:

```yaml
---

nginx_basic_auth:
  - { user: 'coolperson', password: 'heylookatmeicanviewtheprivateblog' }

nginx_sites:
  default:
    domains: ['example.com', 'www.example.com']
    default_server: True
    upstreams:
      - name: 'myapp'
        servers: ['localhost:3000', 'localhost:3001']
  blog:
    domains: ['blog.example.com']
    serve_assets:
      enabled: False
    basic_auth: True
```
